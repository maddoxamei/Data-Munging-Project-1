It is based on the ‘dplyr’ model of piped commands to select and filter data in a single chained function call. This package can installed in RStudio by running the command install.packages(\"rscorecard\") in the console. Merely loading the package is not enough to use its functions. In order to communicate with the server which hosts the data, an API key from the U.S. Department of Education is required. This key acts as an authentication tool. rscorecard::sc_key(APIKey) Our group was interested in the relationship between tuition cost and earnings after graduation across different academic fields. Although there were fields which recorded the proportion of degrees recieved in specific fields, these fields were not well standardized (i.e. “Engineering” vs. “Engineering or related fields”). Therefore, we decided to narrow our scope to special-focus schools, as defined by the basic classification Carnegie Classification method, instead. The special-focus designation was based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus if they met any of the following conditions: Conferred at least 75% of degrees in just one field (as determined by the first two digits of the CIP Code) other than “Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, General Studies or Humanities” (CIP2=24) Conferred 70-74% in one field and conferred degrees in no more than 2 other fields. Conferred 60-69% in one field and conferred degrees in no more than 1 other field. — Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education Table 1.1 provides a list of the school types that we included in our dataset. For a complete list of all school classifications and corresponding definitions/methodology, see Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The specific earnings and tuition variables we considered are located in Table 1.2. Table 1.1: School classifications considered in our analysis. value label 24 Special Focus Four-Year: Faith-Related Institutions 25 Special Focus Four-Year: Medical Schools &amp; Centers 26 Special Focus Four-Year: Other Health Professions Schools 27 Special Focus Four-Year: Engineering Schools 28 Special Focus Four-Year: Other Technology-Related Schools 29 Special Focus Four-Year: Business &amp; Management Schools 30 Special Focus Four-Year: Arts, Music &amp; Design Schools 31 Special Focus Four-Year: Law Schools 32 Special Focus Four-Year: Other Special Focus Institutions Table 1.2: Specific earnings and tuition variables considered in our analysis. Data is obtained through a series of piped functions: sc_init(), sc_filter(), sc_select(), sc_year(), and sc_get(). Unfortunately, the sc_year() function can only take a single-year entry. To simplify the process of grabbing the same data over the course of several years, a simple function was created. get.data &lt;- function(year, vars.vector){ print(paste(&quot;Grabbing data for&quot;,year)) rscorecard::sc_init() %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_filter(ccbasic %in% c(24:32)) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_select_(vars.vector) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_year(year) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_get() } As mentioned earlier, the data collection began back in the 1900’s. As it turns out, the variables of interest to our group, earnings later in life and tuition, were not recorded until 2000. Therefore, the earlier years are excluded from our analysis. years &lt;- c(2000:as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), &quot;%Y&quot;))) csb.data &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows( lapply(years, get.data, vars_to_pull) ) 1.2 Continual Aquisition The server which hosts the college data only allows up to 100 calls at a given time. Due to the use of Github Actions to automatically re-render the report after any changes pushed to the main branch, this access limitation makes it impractical for long-term data sourcing. Therefore, the compiled data was converted into a csv file and stored remotely in Google’s cloud service (Google Drive) to facilitate unrestricted access to the data. write.csv(csb.data, &quot;CollegeScorecardData20to21.csv&quot;, row.names=F) The data stored on Google Drive can henceforth be obtained through a download using the id of the file and the following Google address to access it. id &lt;- &quot;1Sfa6V3vhxQU3wDMTKsPUpnkp9DX8gsOK&quot; csb.data &lt;- read.csv(sprintf(&quot;https://docs.google.com/uc?id=%s&amp;export=download&quot;, id)) "],["data-quality.html", "2 Data Quality", " 2 Data Quality The U.S. Department of Education released their own reports regarding the important properties and limitations of the data along with a data quality segment, delving into detail regarding consistency and completeness assessment of reporting by institutions. All blocked quotes in this chapter are directly obtained from one of the two technical documentation reports released by the U.S. Department of Education. Believability The data is gathered by the U.S. Department of Education, therefore there is no reason to presume intentional falsity in the distributed data. However, credibility of the information is also relient on institution transparency and accurate algorithmic matching. Earnings-related information is one such example of algorithmically obtained/matched information. &gt;NSLDS is the Department’s central database for monitoring Title IV federal student aid…provides administrative data from which loan debt data elements and cohorts for earnings can be constructed. Scorecard linked NSLDS records to administrative tax records maintained by the IRS within the Department of the Treasury. Completeness Consistent Representation Earning values are presented in inflation-adjusted dollars. The inconsistency lies in the reference year for inflation adjustment. Earnings included in the 2011_12 and prior Scorecard data files are inflation adjusted to 2014 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Beginning with the 2012_13 Scorecard data file, earnings included in the XXXX_YY data file are inflation adjusted to XXXX+3 dollars using the CPI- U. For example, earnings included in the 2014_15 Scorecard data file are inflation adjusted to 2017 dollars. The reference year for inflation adjustment is one year following the latest measurement year for the cohort (e.g., earnings measured in calendar years 2016 and 2017 were adjusted to 2018 dollars) Beginning with the 2018_19 data files…earnings inflation adjusted to correspond to the closing year of the data file they are included in (e.g, adjusted to 2019 dollars if included in the 2018_19 data file) Objectivity According to the technical documentation, the earnings data is only tracked for Title IV (federal financial aid) receiving students. Therefore, the data may not be representative of institutions or fields of study with a low proportion of Title IV-eligible students. Furthermore, not all income for Title IV-receiving students is accounted for. &gt;Earnings are defined as the sum of wages and deferred compensation40 from all W-2 forms received for each individual, plus self-employment earnings from Schedule SE. Timeliness New data is released annually. Updates of older data also occurs once newer information becomes available (i.e. retrospectively populating columns regarding metrics that were not tracked at the time of the initial data release). "],["data-preprocessing.html", "3 Data Preprocessing", " 3 Data Preprocessing The raw data we are working with has 18194 rows and 29 columns. A sample of this transposed data is provided below in table 3.1. Note, the transposition occurs to ensure information is not cut off by the edge of the page. Table 3.1: Sample Data. Notice that the columns for the earnings table places the year subsets in the order of 10, 6 then 8. To ensure this ordering is not reflected in the later graphs, the column are renamed and then sorted alphebetically. Originally, the ccbasic (school type) column is an integer. Although the values are integers, they represent categories. Therefore, they must be converted into factors. Factors are R’s equivalent categorical variables. They are treated differently than normal characters. On that note, the unitid is also changed so that the id is treated as an object an not a descrete value. The original data types and altered types of the columns can be found in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Feature Types.

Faith-Related and Health Professional schools each account for approximately \\(1/3\\) of the all the schools. This is an interesting pattern due to the rise in technology-based schools. It is possible they were classified rather as research-based schools or have not been included in the Department of Educations data.
