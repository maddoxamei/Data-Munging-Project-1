The primary purpose of the Scorecard is to provide data to help prospective postsecondary students make informed enrollment decisions — Technical Documentation of the College Scorecard Data Our project seeks to isolate specific variables to answer the following questions: 1. Do specific degrees translate to higher earnings later in life? 2. Do more expensive schools translate to higher earnigns later in life? "],["data-acquisition.html", "1 Data Acquisition 1.1 Initial Acquisition 1.2 Continual Aquisition", " 1 Data Acquisition 1.1 Initial Acquisition As opposed to downloading large csv datasets, we decided to use rscorcard to retrieve only the relevant information. rscorecard is a R wrapper for U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard Data API which allows for the remotly access and download the Department of Education’s College Scorecard data. It is based on the ‘dplyr’ model of piped commands to select and filter data in a single chained function call. This package can installed in RStudio by running the command install.packages(\"rscorecard\") in the console. Merely loading the package is not enough to use its functions. In order to communicate with the server which hosts the data, an API key from the U.S. Department of Education is required. This key acts as an authentication tool. rscorecard::sc_key(APIKey) Our group was interested in the relationship between tuition cost and earnings after graduation across different academic fields. Although there were fields which recorded the proportion of degrees recieved in specific fields, these fields were not well standardized (i.e. “Engineering” vs. “Engineering or related fields”). Therefore, we decided to narrow our scope to special-focus schools, as defined by the basic classification Carnegie Classification method, instead. The special-focus designation was based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus if they met any of the following conditions: Conferred at least 75% of degrees in just one field (as determined by the first two digits of the CIP Code) other than “Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences, General Studies or Humanities” (CIP2=24) Conferred 70-74% in one field and conferred degrees in no more than 2 other fields. Conferred 60-69% in one field and conferred degrees in no more than 1 other field. — Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education Table 1.1 provides a list of the school types that we included in our dataset. For a complete list of all school classifications and corresponding definitions/methodology, see Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The specific earnings and tuition variables we considered are located in Table 1.2.

Data is obtained through a series of piped functions: sc_init(), sc_filter(), sc_select(), sc_year(), and sc_get(). Unfortunately, the sc_year() function can only take a single-year entry. To simplify the process of grabbing the same data over the course of several years, a simple function was created. get.data &lt;- function(year, vars.vector){ print(paste(&quot;Grabbing data for&quot;,year)) rscorecard::sc_init() %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_filter(ccbasic %in% c(24:32)) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_select_(vars.vector) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_year(year) %&gt;% rscorecard::sc_get() } As mentioned earlier, the data collection began back in the 1900’s. As it turns out, the variables of interest to our group, earnings later in life and tuition, were not recorded until 2000. Therefore, the earlier years are excluded from our analysis. years &lt;- c(2000:as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), &quot;%Y&quot;))) csb.data &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows( lapply(years, get.data, vars_to_pull) ) 1.2 Continual Aquisition The server which hosts the college data only allows up to 100 calls at a given time. Due to the use of Github Actions to automatically re-render the report after any changes pushed to the main branch, this access limitation makes it impractical for long-term data sourcing. Therefore, the compiled data was converted into a csv file and stored remotely in Google’s cloud service (Google Drive) to facilitate unrestricted access to the data. write.csv(csb.data, &quot;CollegeScorecardData20to21.csv&quot;, row.names=F) The data stored on Google Drive can henceforth be obtained through a download using the id of the file and the following Google address to access it. id &lt;- &quot;1Sfa6V3vhxQU3wDMTKsPUpnkp9DX8gsOK&quot; csb.data &lt;- read.csv(sprintf(&quot;https://docs.google.com/uc?id=%s&amp;export=download&quot;, id)) "],["data-quality.html", "2 Data Quality", " 2 Data Quality The U.S. Department of Education released their own reports regarding the important properties and limitations of the data along with a data quality segment, delving into detail regarding consistency and completeness assessment of reporting by institutions. All blocked quotes in this chapter are directly obtained from one of the two technical documentation reports released by the U.S. Department of Education. Believability The data is gathered by the U.S. Department of Education, therefore there is no reason to presume intentional falsity in the distributed data. However, credibility of the information is also relient on institution transparency and accurate algorithmic matching. Earnings-related information is one such example of algorithmically obtained/matched information. &gt;NSLDS is the Department’s central database for monitoring Title IV federal student aid…provides administrative data from which loan debt data elements and cohorts for earnings can be constructed. Scorecard linked NSLDS records to administrative tax records maintained by the IRS within the Department of the Treasury. Completeness na.test(csb.data[!colnames(csb.data) %in% c(&quot;unitid&quot;, &quot;instnm&quot;, &quot;ccbasic&quot;)]) To test completeness we checked the number of NA values contained in each column and present the number of values that can be pushed into statistical analysis as percentages of the total entries. The general test checks for boolean, numeric and character/factor column types, with the majority of variables we chose being numeric in nature (the character columns, which we subset out, are observation identifiers). Many of the variables related to earnings had roughly \\(%85-90\\) of the values as N/A’s whereas there was more usable data in variables pertaining to cost/tuition, with roughly \\(%60-70\\) NA values. Consistent Representation There is inconsistencies regarding which monetary amounts are numeric and which are inflation-adjusted. For example, tuition/cost are raw values representative of the year they were documented in whereas earning values are presented in inflation-adjusted dollars. More inconsistency lies in the reference year for inflation adjustment. Earnings included in the 2011_12 and prior Scorecard data files are inflation adjusted to 2014 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Beginning with the 2012_13 Scorecard data file, earnings included in the XXXX_YY data file are inflation adjusted to XXXX+3 dollars using the CPI- U. For example, earnings included in the 2014_15 Scorecard data file are inflation adjusted to 2017 dollars. The reference year for inflation adjustment is one year following the latest measurement year for the cohort (e.g., earnings measured in calendar years 2016 and 2017 were adjusted to 2018 dollars) Beginning with the 2018_19 data files…earnings inflation adjusted to correspond to the closing year of the data file they are included in (e.g, adjusted to 2019 dollars if included in the 2018_19 data file) Objectivity According to the technical documentation, the earnings data is only tracked for Title IV (federal financial aid) receiving students. Therefore, the data may not be representative of institutions or fields of study with a low proportion of Title IV-eligible students. Furthermore, not all income for Title IV-receiving students is accounted for. &gt;Earnings are defined as the sum of wages and deferred compensation40 from all W-2 forms received for each individual, plus self-employment earnings from Schedule SE. Timeliness New data is released annually. Updates of older data also occurs once newer information becomes available (i.e. retrospectively populating columns regarding metrics that were not tracked at the time of the initial data release). "],["data-preprocessing.html", "3 Data Preprocessing", " 3 Data Preprocessing The raw data we are working with has 18194 rows and 29 columns. A sample of this transposed data is provided below in table 3.1. Note, the transposition occurs to ensure information is not cut off by the edge of the page. Table 3.1: Sample Data. Notice that the columns for the earnings table places the year subsets in the order of 10, 6 then 8. To ensure this ordering is not reflected in the later graphs, the column are renamed and then sorted alphebetically. Originally, the ccbasic (school type) column is an integer. Although the values are integers, they represent categories. Therefore, they must be converted into factors. Factors are R’s equivalent categorical variables. They are treated differently than normal characters. On that note, the unitid is also changed so that the id is treated as an object an not a descrete value. The original data types and altered types of the columns can be found in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Feature Types. As mentioned earlier, the earnings features are all inflation adjusted, but to different years. In order to minimize the effect of economic health on our results, all the monetary values are inflated or deflated to the target year 2020. All cost of attendance related values are also adjusted to 2020. Table 3.3 provides the base assumptions of what years the earnings values have been adjusted to based on the information in the Technical Documentation of the Scorecard reports. Table 3.3: Base assumptions of inflation years "],["descriptive-statistics.html", "4 Descriptive Statistics 4.1 School Type 4.2 Earnings Variable 4.3 Cost Variable 4.4 Relationship Between Earnings and Cost", " 4 Descriptive Statistics All the charts, plots, and tables contained in this section are interactive. Hover over content to obtain more information. Earnings are measured annually and track the income of Title-IV receiving students 6, 8, and 10 years after entering a postsecondary school. For clarity in interpreting trends, the 6, 8, and 10 measurement periods will be refered to as markers (i.e. 6-year marker). The timeline unit of sequentially measured dates will be refered to directly as year(s). 4.1 School Type As revealed by Figure 4.1, the proportion of schools in each category is consistent across the all years. Faith-Related and Health Professional schools each account for approximately \\(1/3\\) of the all the schools. This is an interesting pattern due to the rise in technology-based schools. It is possible they were classified rather as research-based schools or have not been included in the Department of Education’s data scope. Figure 4.1: School Distribution 4.2 Earnings Variable All the earnings data that is presented in the following figures spans from 2003 - 2014. Earnings information has been calculated in the later years, however that information is stored in separate “field of study” data section. Although we could have aggregated information from two different sources, it was easier to just move forward with the more limited scope. All the earning figures have designations which identify the income tax-brackets (Tiers) using the 2021 tax information. The 6-year mark median earnings have gradually fallen each year since 2009. In contrast, the 10-year mark median earnings have consistently risen since their first reporting back in 2007. The 8-year mark median earnings have remained moreorless consistent throught the years. Although the 10-year mark median earnings are noticeably higher, the overall range of earnings encompasses all those of the lower-year marks. Some 10-year mark individuals even earn less than the least paid 6-year mark counterparts. Figure 4.2 depicts this relationship. When hovering, some boxplots might display a 90th percentile of \\(-1\\). This was implemented as a workaround for the limitations of the graphics package that was used. When interpreting results, keep in mind that this indicates there were no recorded 90th percentile earnings for any school in that given year. Figure 4.2: Percentiles of Earnings The U.S. Department of Education reports both the mean and standard deviation of earnings. Figure 4.3 depicts the percentiles and distribution of the mean earnings, as well as the average standard deviation for each year-marker in a given year. Note, that the standard deviation is not measuring the variability of the mean earnings, but rather the variation of the actual earnings from the distribution of means. Unlike the median earning trends, the three year-marker median mean-earnings are more consistent across the years. All three markers are also unimodal, though the 8-year markers do have a small aggregation of means near the Tier 3/4 cutoff point. Since 2003, the variability of income has increased for all 3 year-markers, though the increase is more significant in higher-year markers. The distribution of all the mean earnings is heavily positively skewed, meaning there are a few schools with significantly higher mean incomes. Figure 4.3: Average Earnings by Year Similarly to Figure 4.3, Figure 4.4 depicts the distribution of mean earnings and average standard deviation of actual incomes. The difference is that it breaks down earnings by school type as opposed to over time. Other Special Focus Institutions is distinctly bi-modal, with a smaller mode occurring below the first quartile. Engineering schools also appears to be bi-modal, but the modes are not as pronounced as the data a bit more variety compartively. Medical Schools &amp; Centers have the most variety, followed by law school. Figure 4.4: Average Earnings by Type 4.3 Cost Variable Because in-state and out-of-state tuition costs appear to be gradually increasing over the years at the same rate, the results of using just one when analyzing the cost to earnings relationship is comparable to if the other had been used. Cost of attendance is a much more holistic way to gauge post-secondary school cost. Unfortunately, this information was only collected starting in 2009. Due to the lack of earnings data for some given years, there is more overlap of data if using tuition in the relationship comparison. Cost of an academic year also seems to remain more or less steady throughout the years. The same can be said regarding the distribution of those three variables as well. The only variable which noticably varies from year is the cost of a program year. Figure 4.5: Cost of Attendence 4.4 Relationship Between Earnings and Cost For the following figures, the size of each circle is based on the standard deviation. In other words, the placement of a point idicates a mean earning for a respective in-state tuition cost whereas the size indicates the amount of variability around that mean earnings value. Note, the size is not a reflection of the actual standard deviation value, rather a relative value of it. Over the years, the tuition for postsecondary schools has increased, on average. With this increase in cost, the mean earnings later in life have linearly increased for Medical Schools &amp; Centers and Business &amp; Management Schools. For all other schools, the tuition has risen without a significant change in mean earnings later in life. This is reflected in both Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7. Considering the boom in Engineering/Technology-Related degrees, with boasted higher earnings straight out of college, average out to be equivalent later in life. Such trends potentially indicates experience, rather than academic education, is the more significant factor in evaluating payment. Other Health Professions Schools have the most “scattered” tuition-to-earnings spread.
