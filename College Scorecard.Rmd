```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Directories

```{r}
rscripts <- "R Scripts"
```

## Dataset Preprocessing

**Subsetting the columns** isolates the columns which are relavent to answering the question we are asking.

```{r}
source(file.path(rscripts, "subset_data.R"))
csb21.sub <- subset.data(read.csv("Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv"), seed=1234)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
