## School Type

As revealed by Figure \@ref(fig:schooldistribution), the proportion of schools in each category is consistent across the all years. Faith-Related and Health Professional schools _each_ account for approximately $1/3$ of the all the schools. This is an interesting pattern due to the rise in technology-based schools. It is possible they were classified rather as research-based schools or have not been included in the Department of Educations data.

```{r schooldistribution, fig.cap="School Distribution", echo=FALSE}
school.distribution()
```

## Earnings Variable

```{r earningspercentiles, fig.cap="Percentiles of Earnings", echo=F}
earnings.percentiles.year()
```

```{r earningssd, fig.cap="Standard Deviation of Earnigns", echo=F}
earnings.sd()
```

## Cost Variable

```{r tutionstream, fig.cap="Tuition Over the Years", echo=F}
tuition.stream()
```

```{r coststream, fig.cap="Cost Over the Years", echo=F}
cost.stream()
```


## Relationship Between Earnings and Cost

```{r costtoearninst, fig.cap="Institution Cost to Earnings", echo=F}
cost.to.earnings(csb.data.unitid, "{point.instnm}", "Averaged across all years")
```

```{r costtoearnyear, fig.cap="Yearly Cost to Earnings", echo=F}
cost.to.earnings(csb.data.year.ccbasic, "{point.year}", "Averaged across all school types")
```
